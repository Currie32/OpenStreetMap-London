# OpenStreetMap-London
OpenStreetMap data about London, UK that I cleaned and analyzed, as part of my Data Analyst Nanodegree from Udacity.

Files:
Report.pdf - The report that I made about the data using Python during the cleaning and exploration phase, 
             and SQL during the analysis phase.
sample_london.osm - is the same of the OpenStreetMap London data. The full dataset is 2.55 GB,
                    so I did not include it on GitHub, but can be found with this link:
                    https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/65606
OpenStreetMapsLondon.html - an html file of how I cleaned the data.
OpenStreetMapsLondon.ipynb - an IPython (Jupyter) notebook file of how I cleaned the data.
OpenStreetMapsLondon.py - an python file of how I cleaned the data.

Note: If you want to use either the .ipynb or .py file to use/alter my code,
      make sure that you change the path of the OSM_FILE to be able to load the data.
