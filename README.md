# OpenStreetMap-London
OpenStreetMap data about London, UK that I cleaned and analyzed, as part of my Data Analyst Nanodegree from Udacity.
The data was cleaned and analyzed using python, and information was query and aggregated using SQL for the report.

Files:
Report.pdf - The report that I made about the data using Python during the cleaning and exploration phase, 
             and SQL during the analysis phase.
sample_london.osm - is the same of the OpenStreetMap London data. The full dataset is 2.55 GB,
                    so I did not include it on GitHub, but can be found with this link:
                    https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/65606
OpenStreetMapsLondon.html - an html file of how I cleaned the data.
OpenStreetMapsLondon.ipynb - an IPython (Jupyter) notebook file of how I cleaned the data.
OpenStreetMapsLondon.py - an python file of how I cleaned the data.

Note: If you want to use either the .ipynb or .py file to use/alter my code,
      make sure that you change the path of the OSM_FILE to be able to load the data.
